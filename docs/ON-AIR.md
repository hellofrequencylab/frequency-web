# On Air — the practice timer mini-app (member-facing: **Mindless**)

> Status: **P1–P7 shipped** (ADR-229; desktop intercepted-modal entry deferred — see Roadmap). Canon names: NAMING.md §The Quest ("On Air" =
> internal name; member-facing the app is **Mindless**, verb **"tune out"**; "Airtime", "Dispatch from Vera"). Member help: `content/help/the-game/on-air.md`.

One tap → the world goes quiet → you breathe → the game pays you in person → Vera
hands you tomorrow's thread. A little app inside The Quest, and the intended daily
anchor for WAM.

## Why it's built this way (research)

- **The reveal is the retention engine, not the timer.** Duolingo stages the streak
  increment *inside* the lesson flow — the state change is the session's payoff.
  On Air does the same: the streak ticks over on a full screen you swipe through,
  never a badge discovered later.
- **Insight Timer beats Calm/Headspace ~2× on D30 retention** on the strength of a
  *customizable ritual* (your duration, your pattern, remembered setup), radical
  stats transparency, and a sub-5-minute no-guilt floor. We copy the ritual, not
  the content library.
- **Variable reward at completion** (Duolingo's chest): already live — Surprises
  (ADR-210) ride `logPractice` and surface in the reveal's bonus cascade for free.
- **Honest distraction-blocking:** a web app cannot suppress OS notifications
  (Opal/one sec use OS Screen Time APIs). The truthful web version is Wake Lock +
  Fullscreen (+ PWA standalone, P3) — screen stays lit, chrome disappears.

## The loop

```
ENTER (1 tap)            SESSION                     THE REVEAL (swipe →)
feed JourneyBoard ⚡  →   fullscreen 'On Air'    →    ① Rewards   zaps + bonus cascade + surprise
practice page button      wake lock · visualizer      ② Streak    N-1 → N, milestone bar, freezes
/on-air direct            quiet End, no shame         ③ Stats     airtime + depth + Amplitude
                                                      ④ Dispatch  Vera's next assignment
```

## Architecture (P1)

| Piece | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Route | `app/(main)/on-air/` | Focus surface; `'/on-air'` registered `'none'` in `lib/layout/page-chrome.ts` |
| Session machine | `components/on-air/session.tsx` | setup → live → saving → reveal; wake lock + mobile fullscreen, re-acquired on visibility |
| Visualizer | `components/on-air/visualizer.tsx` | RippleRings motif breathing; rAF writes transforms via refs (no React frame-rate renders); reduced-motion → opacity fade |
| Breath math | `lib/on-air.ts` (+ tests) | Box 4-4-4-4 · Coherent 5.5 · 4-7-8; `breathPositionAt` / `ringScaleAt` pure |
| Completion | `app/(main)/on-air/actions.ts` | ONE action: insert `practice_sessions` → **`logPractice()` (the only economy entry — same idempotency, zaps, bonuses, streaks)** → gather reveal payload → Dispatch |
| Reveal | `components/on-air/reveal.tsx` | 4 scroll-snap panels; bonus cascade staged 550ms apart; type-on Dispatch card |
| Dispatch engine | `lib/vera-dispatch.ts` | See below |
| Data | `supabase/migrations/20260615000000_on_air.sql` | `practice_sessions` (mode/pattern/seconds — airtime + history) + `vera_dispatches` (one per member/day, cached); RLS read-own |
| Prefs | `profiles.meta.onAir` | last mode/pattern/minutes (zero-config repeat) + `onAirTotalSeconds` (lifetime airtime counter — hosted PostgREST has aggregates off; sessions table can recompute) |

**Invariant: On Air is a stage, never a second economy.** A session that ends calls
`logPractice()` and nothing else pays. A practice already logged today still records
a session (airtime) — the reveal shows "already counted" honestly, streak intact.

## Dispatches from Vera

Two layers so it's fast, cheap, and never wrong:

1. **The WHAT is deterministic** (`resolveAssignment`): priority = next Journey step
   due → challenge ≥50% done → no event attendance this week → depth mark ≤5 logs
   away → steady default. All reads from existing systems.
2. **The VOICE** (P2, shipped): `voiceCopy()` asks Haiku to rephrase the payload's
   fact line (names + numbers verbatim, 140-char cap) behind the standard
   `aiAvailable` + `featureOverBudget('vera-dispatch')` gates, with usage recorded
   to the AI ledger. `cleanDispatchCopy` validates the result (strips quotes /
   prefixes, swaps em dashes, rejects emoji / junk lengths) so a model hiccup can
   never reach a member; the P1 templates remain the always-on fallback. Whatever
   copy is minted is what replays forever (the cache row marks `voiced`).

Cached one per (member, day) in `vera_dispatches` (unique race → read the winner).
Replays and the history scroll (`listDispatches`) read the table — **no live Vera
on revisit**, by design.

## Roadmap

- ~~P2 — Vera live~~ ✅ shipped: AI phrasing + the Dispatch archive at `/on-air/dispatches`.
- ~~P3 — the takeover~~ ✅ shipped: PWA "Go On Air" manifest shortcut, interval
  bell (Web Audio synth, opt-in) + haptic phase cues (opt-in), presence line
  ("N members practiced today", shown at ≥3), custom pattern sliders (3–8s/phase,
  hold may be 0). Deferred from P3: the desktop intercepted-modal entry — it
  touches the shared (main) layout while parallel admin-chrome work is active;
  pick it up once that settles.
- ~~P4 — beauty pass~~ ✅ shipped: four reveal spot scenes in the welcome-art
  language (components/on-air/reveal-art.tsx), the zap count-up (700ms ease-out),
  the streak N−1 → N tick with pulse (skipped on "already counted" sits), a
  one-shot celebration dot burst, and luminosity-breathing holds on the
  visualizer. Everything bows out under prefers-reduced-motion. Optional ambient
  audio remains unscheduled.

- ~~P5 — mobile polish (owner feedback)~~ ✅ shipped: the live session, saving
  state and reveal now run in a TRUE full-viewport takeover (`fixed inset-0 z-50`,
  above the app header and tab bar) until done or End; bigger rings + a flashing
  per-phase breath counter in the center; larger ON AIR indicator; chevron swipe
  indicators flanking the reveal dots; swiping (or arrowing) past the last card
  slides it off and closes the mode back to a refreshed setup; free-form minutes
  stepper (1–120) beside the presets; three bell voices (Soft / Low / Bowl) with
  a tap preview; an On Air radio icon in the global header (since retired by the
  Zap button owner pass, ADR-230 — On Air's entries are the Zap menu's
  full-width Mindless row, the JourneyBoard, practice pages, /on-air and the
  PWA shortcut).

- ~~P6 — live-screen pass (owner feedback)~~ ✅ shipped: more air in the live
  column (title down, End up); the title now reads **Mindless** under a lotus
  mark, softly pulsing; swiping off the last reveal card returns to the screen
  the member came from (history back) instead of always the setup; and every
  On Air control wears a custom SVG mark from the new kit
  (`components/on-air/icons.tsx` — lotus, breath ring, dial, bolt, bell,
  vibration, broadcast) in the zap-menu-art language, replacing the stock
  lucide glyphs.

- ~~P7 — the member-facing name~~ ✅ shipped: member surfaces say **Mindless**
  and the verb is **"tune out"** ("tune back in" = done): setup title +
  metadata + CTA, the Zap menu door (moved between the live and coming-soon
  rows, lotus-on-water art), the lotus entry buttons on the JourneyBoard and
  practice pages (Radio glyph retired there), the Dispatch archive, the saving
  line, the reveal exit, the PWA shortcut, help and changelog. "On Air" stays
  the internal name (this doc, routes, schema, ADRs); Airtime keeps its name.

Metrics to watch (gamification admin): timer-start → completion rate, reveal
swipe-through depth, share of WAM logging via On Air, D7 repeat.
